# Minimalistic starter template for Three.js

This is my own starter template for working with small to medium sized WebGL-projects using Three.js. It features some of the things I almost always need for quick prototyping. Still WIP.

## Features

- Simple asset loading and management (textures, glb/gltf)
- Pointer-events for mouse/touch handling
- glslify for convenient shader modules
- Parcel as the build system
- Orbitcontrols for easy camera movement
- FPS meter using stats.js
